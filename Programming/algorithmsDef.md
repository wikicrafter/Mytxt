### Some commonly used algorithms and data structures:

* Searching algorithms: Linear search and binary search.
* Sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.
* Data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, and graphs.
* String algorithms: Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm and Rabin-Karp algorithm
* Divide and conquer algorithms: Merge sort, Quick sort
* Dynamic Programming: Bellman Ford, Floyd Warshall, Dijkstra’s algorithm
* Greedy Algorithms: Prim's, Kruskal's, Dijkstra's


In general it depends on what kind of problem we are trying to solve and what our constraints are, as different algorithms have different time and space complexity, as well as different trade-offs between the two.
