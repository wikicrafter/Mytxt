### I wanna explain a bit about blockchain:
1. A blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger of transactions that is used to record transactions across a network of computers. The technology was first introduced as the underlying infrastructure for the digital currency Bitcoin, but it has since been adapted for a wide range of other uses.
2. The transactions are grouped into blocks and each block is linked to the one before it, creating a chain of blocks (hence the name "blockchain"). Each block contains a record of multiple transactions and a unique code, called a "hash," that distinguishes it from other blocks in the chain. Once a block is added to the blockchain, the data it contains cannot be altered, making the blockchain a secure and tamper-proof way to store information.
3. The key feature of blockchain technology is that it is decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by any single entity. Instead, the network of computers that make up the blockchain work together to record and validate transactions. This eliminates the need for a central authority, such as a bank, to oversee and approve transactions. Additionally, the blockchain is distributed, meaning that a copy of the entire blockchain is stored on every computer in the network, so there is no single point of failure.
4. Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries, from finance and banking to supply chain management and voting systems. Some of the benefits of blockchain include increased security, transparency, and immutability of records.
5. It is important to note that the technology behind blockchain, called distributed ledger technology (DLT), is the basis of many other projects and technologies, like smart-contracts, and many other decentralized applications.

### A bit about DLT technology 
1. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is the underlying technology that powers blockchain systems. It is a type of database that is spread across a network of computers, rather than being stored in a central location. In DLT, a copy of the entire database is stored on each computer in the network, and all copies of the database are constantly synced with each other to ensure that they are all up-to-date.
2. DLT allows for the decentralized and distributed storage of information, which eliminates the need for a central authority to oversee and approve transactions. This is what makes blockchain technology and other DLT-based systems so secure and tamper-proof, as there is no single point of failure in the network.
3. One of the key features of DLT is that it uses consensus algorithms to validate transactions. This means that all computers on the network must agree that a transaction is valid before it can be added to the database. This ensures that only valid transactions are recorded, and helps to prevent fraud and other types of misconduct.
4. DLT can be used for a wide range of applications beyond blockchain, such as supply chain management, voting systems, and digital identity management. In these applications, DLT allows for secure, transparent and tamper-proof recording of transactions.
5. It's also worth noting that there are different types of distributed ledgers, such as public and private. Public ledgers are open to anyone, and are the most common type of blockchain. Private ledgers are only accessible to a select group of participants and are typically used for enterprise solutions or consortiums.
