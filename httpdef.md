The cornerstone of the internet is the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), a set of guidelines that control how data is exchanged between 
web clients (such web browsers) and servers. The HTTP protocol has different iterations, including:

* The first HTTP protocol, released in 1991, was version 0.9. It was a short-lived, 
straightforward single-request/single-response protocol that was replaced by later iterations.
* Released in 1996, HTTP/1.0 provided support for headers, caching, and various request methods 
(including GET and POST). Although newer versions have subsequently supplanted it, it was widely used in the early days of the internet.
* Released in 1999, HTTP/1.1 improved upon and expanded upon the functions offered by HTTP/1.0. In addition to other things, it improved 
caching and included support for permanent connections as well as the Host header. The most extensively used version of the protocol is 
HTTP/1.1, which is still in use today.
* Released in 2015, HTTP/2 is a significant upgrade to the HTTP protocol that aims to increase speed and decrease latency. It includes 
a number of new features, such as server push, multiplexing, binary framing, and more effective compression.
* HTTP/3: Released in 2019, HTTP/3 is the most recent version of the protocol, which aims to improve the performance of HTTP even further 
and to make it more robust in the face of poor network conditions. It uses the QUIC protocol, developed by Google, which is built on top of 
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) rather than TCP. It also has support for Binary Framing

Each version of HTTP has different features and capabilities. But most of the web development using HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 as it is widely supported 
in most of the web clients and servers.
