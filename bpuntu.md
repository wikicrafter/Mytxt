# Things u shall to udnerstand untill learning any programming language

* Data types and variables: understanding the different types of data (e.g. strings, integers, lists) and how to store and manipulate them.

* Control flow: understanding how to use constructs like loops and conditionals to control the flow of execution in a program.

* Algorithms: understanding how to design and implement algorithms to solve problems.

* Function: Understanding the basic structure of a function, when and how to use them, and how to call them.

* Syntax: understanding the specific syntax of the programming language you are using, including its keywords, operators, and grammar.

* Debugging: understanding how to use debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix errors in your code.

* Good programming practice: understanding how to write clean, readable, and maintainable code.

It's also important to practice using these concepts by working on small programming projects and experimenting with different features of the 
programming language.
Additionally, having general computer skills like how to navigate the file system, use an editor, and work with command-line interfaces will be helpful to you.
