# Things u shall to udnerstand untill learning any programming language

* Data types and variables: understanding the different types of data (e.g. strings, integers, lists) and how to store and manipulate them.

* Control flow: understanding how to use constructs like loops and conditionals to control the flow of execution in a program.

* Algorithms: understanding how to design and implement algorithms to solve problems.

* Function: Understanding the basic structure of a function, when and how to use them, and how to call them.

* Syntax: understanding the specific syntax of the programming language you are using, including its keywords, operators, and grammar.

* Debugging: understanding how to use debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix errors in your code.

* Good programming practice: understanding how to write clean, readable, and maintainable code.

It's also important to practice using these concepts by working on small programming projects and experimenting with different features of the 
programming language.
Additionally, having general computer skills like how to navigate the file system, use an editor, and work with command-line interfaces will be helpful to you.

## Let's dive a bit deeper with data types and variable: 
In programming, a data type is a classification of types of data that determines the type of values a variable can store and the operations that can be performed on that data. Common data types include:
* Integer: a whole number, such as 42 or -10.
* Floating-point: a number with a decimal point, such as 3.14 or -0.01.
* String: a sequence of characters, such as "hello" or "how are you?".
* Boolean: a value that is either true or false.
* List: an ordered collection of other data types, such as [1, 2, 3] or ["apple", "banana", "cherry"].
* Dictionary: an unordered collection of key-value pairs, such as {"apple": 1, "banana": 2, "cherry": 3}.

A variable is a container that holds a value, which can be of a specific data type. For example, you can create an integer variable 
called "age" and assign it the value "20". Later in your program, you could change the value of the "age" variable to "21". The variable 
name allows you to refer to the stored value, and you can perform operations on the value using the appropriate operations for its data type.

You can also convert values between different data types using casting methods, like (int() or float()) functions.
t's important to understand the different data types and their properties, and how to use variables to store and manipulate data in your program.
It's also important to note that different languages have different way of dealing with data types and their specific methods for conversion, 
for example some languages are strong typed and some are weak typed, etc.
