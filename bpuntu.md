# Things u shall to udnerstand untill learning any programming language

* Data types and variables: understanding the different types of data (e.g. strings, integers, lists) and how to store and manipulate them.

* Control flow: understanding how to use constructs like loops and conditionals to control the flow of execution in a program.

* Algorithms: understanding how to design and implement algorithms to solve problems.

* Function: Understanding the basic structure of a function, when and how to use them, and how to call them.

* Syntax: understanding the specific syntax of the programming language you are using, including its keywords, operators, and grammar.

* Debugging: understanding how to use debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix errors in your code.

* Good programming practice: understanding how to write clean, readable, and maintainable code.

It's also important to practice using these concepts by working on small programming projects and experimenting with different features of the 
programming language.
Additionally, having general computer skills like how to navigate the file system, use an editor, and work with command-line interfaces will be helpful to you.

## Let's dive a bit deeper with data types and variable: 
In programming, a data type is a classification of types of data that determines the type of values a variable can store and the operations that can be performed on that data. Common data types include:
* Integer: a whole number, such as 42 or -10.
* Floating-point: a number with a decimal point, such as 3.14 or -0.01.
* String: a sequence of characters, such as "hello" or "how are you?".
* Boolean: a value that is either true or false.
* List: an ordered collection of other data types, such as [1, 2, 3] or ["apple", "banana", "cherry"].
* Dictionary: an unordered collection of key-value pairs, such as {"apple": 1, "banana": 2, "cherry": 3}.

A variable is a container that holds a value, which can be of a specific data type. For example, you can create an integer variable 
called "age" and assign it the value "20". Later in your program, you could change the value of the "age" variable to "21". The variable 
name allows you to refer to the stored value, and you can perform operations on the value using the appropriate operations for its data type.

You can also convert values between different data types using casting methods, like (int() or float()) functions.
t's important to understand the different data types and their properties, and how to use variables to store and manipulate data in your program.
It's also important to note that different languages have different way of dealing with data types and their specific methods for conversion, 
for example some languages are strong typed and some are weak typed, etc.

## Let's dive deeper with control flow:
Control flow refers to the order in which the instructions in a program are executed. 
Constructs like loops and conditionals are used to control the flow of execution in a program by allowing the developer to specify different actions 
to be taken based on different conditions or to repeat actions a certain number of times.

For example, a loop can be used to iterate over a collection of data, and perform a certain action for each item in the collection. 
A conditional statement, such as an if-else statement, can be used to check a condition and determine which block of code to execute based on whether 
the condition is true or false.

In summary, Control flow constructs are used to control the order in which instructions are executed in a program, making the program more flexible and adaptable to changing inputs and situations.

## Algorithms: understanding how to design and implement algorithms to solve problems:

An algorithm is a set of instructions that can be followed in order to solve a specific problem or accomplish a specific task. 
To design and implement an algorithm, one must first understand the problem to be solved, and then determine the steps that are 
needed to solve it

The process of designing an algorithm can involve breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, identifying any patterns or structures in the data, 
and selecting the appropriate data structures and algorithms to use. Once the algorithm has been designed, it can then be implemented in a specific programming language.

In practice, understanding how to design and implement algorithms requires:
