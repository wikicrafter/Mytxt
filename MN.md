<li>
<p>Nmap: Nmap is a network scanner that can be used to map out a network and detect devices and services running on it. It can be used to detect new devices that have appeared on the network and identify potential security risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suricata: Suricata is an open-source network threat detection tool that can be used to detect and prevent cyberattacks. It supports multiple intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) methods and can be used to monitor network traffic in real-time.</p>

<p>When choosing a tool to monitor your network, consider your specific needs and the size and complexity of your network. Some tools, such as Wireshark, are more technical and require a deeper understanding of networking, while others, such as Nagios, are more user-friendly and easier to set up and use.</p>
<p>Remember, regularly monitoring your network is a critical step in detecting and preventing security threats. By using open-source tools, you can keep a close eye on your network and stay ahead of potential security risks.</p>
