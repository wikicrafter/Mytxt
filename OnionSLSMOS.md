<p>Here is a list of some operating systems that are based on the onion-style, layered security model:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Tails: A live operating system that can be run from a USB drive or DVD. Tails is designed to provide a secure and privacy-focused computing environment by routing all Internet traffic through the Tor network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qubes OS: An open-source operating system that uses virtualization to provide security through isolation. Qubes OS uses multiple virtual machines to separate different tasks, making it more difficult for attackers to compromise the entire system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subgraph OS: A privacy-focused operating system that uses application isolation and sandboxing to protect against malware and other security threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whonix: An open-source operating system that is designed to provide privacy and security by routing all Internet traffic through the Tor network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BlackBox: A privacy-focused operating system that uses encryption to protect sensitive data and provides secure communication through the Tor network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kalixir: An open-source operating system that uses a combination of virtualization and encryption to provide security and privacy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These operating systems are designed to provide increased security and privacy compared to traditional operating systems, and are often used by privacy-conscious individuals and organizations. However, it is important to note that no operating system is completely immune to security threats, and it is still important to practice safe computing habits and keep your system up to date with the latest security patches.</p>
