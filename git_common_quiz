## Git

#### Q1. How can you check your current git version?

- [x] git --version


#### Q2. What command lets you create a connection between a local and remote repository?

- [x] git remote add new
- [x] git remote add origin


The command is git remote add. The new added connection can be named origin or new. The only constraints, although it is not documented AFAIK, is that the connection name needs to be acceptable to git-check-ref-format, and it cannot be repeated.
If the LinkedIn assessment asks this and you can choose just one option, then leave feedback.

#### Q3. Describe what the following git commands do to the commit history.

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~5
git merge --squash HEAD@{1}
```

- [x] Reset the commit branch back before the last 5 commits, then squashes them into a single commit

**Explanation:**

- `git reset --hard HEAD~5` resets the current branch to the commit just before the last 5 (see `man gitrevisions` for details about this notation and other cool alternatives like `HEAD@{2 days ago}`). As it is a hard reset, it will also overwrite every change in the working tree as well. See `man git-reset`.
- `git merge --squash HEAD@{1}` HEAD@{1} is where the branch was just before the previous command (again, see `man gitrevisions`). This command sets the state of the index to be as it would just after a merge from that commit. This whole operation could be a way to take 5 commits from a branch in which you started a new feature and squash them to a single commit, a meaningful one.

#### Q4. Your current project has several branches; master, beta, and push-notifications. You've just finished the notification feature in the push-notification branch, and you want to commit it to beta branch. How can you accomplish this?

- [x] Checkout the beta branch and run git merge push-notification

#### Q5. Which of the following is true you when you use the following command?

`git add -A`

- [x] All new and updated files are staged

#### Q6. What will the following command print to the Terminal?

`git remote -v`

- [x] A list of remote repositories and their URLs


#### Q7. Looking at the following commands, describe what is happening.

```bash
git checkout feature-user-location
git cherry-pick kj2342134sdf090093f0sdgasdf99sdfo992mmmf9921231
```

- [x] The commit is being cherry picked as the new HEAD of the commit history

**Explanation:** Commits aren't copied when cherry picking, they are cherry picked. The changes introduced by the commit are applied and a new commit is then created. This allow us to get specific changes as if they were patches (in the GIT's book, this is actually called [Patching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C:-Git-Commands-Patching "See this in the GIT's book")). As a new commit is created upon feature-user-location, HEAD also changes to match it. You can see this in `cat .git/HEAD` and `cat .git/refs/heads/feature-user-location` for this case. See `man git-cherry-pick` for details.

**NOTE**: There are two versions of this question so far. The task is always "describe what is happening", the commands are always a `checkout` and a `cherry-pick`, and the correct answer is always the same.

#### Q8. What does the following command do to the git repository?

`git reset --soft HEAD^`


- [x] It sets HEAD to the previous commit and leaves changes from the undone commit in the stage/index.

#### Q9. You find a bug in your project, but can't locate where it was introduced in the commit history. How would you diagnose this problem?

- [x] Use git bisect to compare the buggy commit to an early commit that works as expected.

#### Q10. Why would the following command be used?

`git rebase -i HEAD~10`


- [x] To list the last 10 commits and modify them with either the squash or fixup command


#### Q11. Why would you use a pre-receive hook in your remote repository?

- [x] To execute a script when a remote receives a push that is triggered before any refs are updated


#### Q12. What option can you use to apply git configurations across your entire git environment?


- [x] `--global`


#### Q13. How could you squash multiple commits together without using git merge --squash?


- [x] Rebasing


#### Q14. If you cloned an existing git repository, what would happen?


- [x] A copy of the repository would be created on your local machine

#### Q15. How can you display a list of files added or modified in a specific commit?

- [x] Use the `diff-tree` command with the commit hash.


#### Q16. What files is this .gitignore programmed to leave out?

```shell
#.swift
build/

*.txt
*.metadata
```


- [x] All files in the build directory, as well as files ending with .txt or .metadata


A line starting with `#` serves as a comment. Hence `# .swift` does not do anything. See `man gitignore`.

#### Q17. After you make changes to a local repository, you run the following command. What will this do?

`git commit -a -m "Refactor code base"`


- [x] Adds all modified files to the staging area, then commits them with a message

#### Q18. After checking your git status you get the following output, which shows the file beta-notes.js in the commit but also unstaged. How can this situation occur?

```shell
Change to be committed:

(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
modified: beta-notes.js
Changes not staged for commit:
(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
(use "git checkout --<file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

modified: beta-notes.js
```


- [x] beta-notes.js was staged, then modified afterwards, creating two different versions of the file


#### Q19. Where are files stored before they are committed to the local repository?


- [x] Staging area


#### Q20. What commands would you use to force an overwrite of your local files with the master branch?


- [x] â €

  ```bash
  git fetch --all
  git reset --hard origin/master
  ```

- The command `pull` is `fetch` followed by either `merge` or `rebase` (in this case, `merge`). We don't want to merge. Merge would be an action to our **repository**. We just want to overwrite our **local files**.

#### Q21. Which statement is true when you use the git add -A command?


- [x] All new and updated files from the working directory are staged to the index.


#### Q22. You find that your project has a tag and branch both named push-notifications, which causes confusion when trying to print out given reference. How can you specify which branch you want to look at?


- [x] use git show refs/head/push-notifications

[Reference](https://geedew.com/fixing-git-branch-and-tag-name-collision/)

#### Q23. Your team lead needs a list of all commits that will be moved before you perform a rebase. Which command can you use to access that information?


- [x] git rebase -i


#### Q24. What is the operation doing given the Git commands below?

```
git bisect start
git bisect bad 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
git bisect good 69faab6268350295550de7d587bc323d
```


- [x] It performs a binary search using a known bad commit and known good commit to determine which commit introduced a bug

#### Q25. In a situation where you have several commits for a single task, what is the most efficient way to restructure your commit history?


- [x] Squash the related commits together into a single coherent commit.


#### Q26. Which of the following is true of the git push command?

- [x] By default a push doesn't send tags to the remote repository.


[Reference](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging#_sharing_tags)

#### Q27. After pushing commits to the remote repository for the first time using the command below, what shorthand command can you use in future?

```bash
git push -u origin master
```


- [x] git push

#### Q28. How would you create a custom shortcut or command across your git environment?


- [x] Create an alias usin the git config command.

#### Q29. What is the status of the beta-notes.js file in the following output?

```shell
Changes not staged for commit:
(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
(use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

modified: beta-notes.js
```


- [x] beta-notes.js is a tracked file and has been modified, but has not been added to the current commit.

- [x] Use git stash to save your work and come back later and reapply the stashed commit.

#### Q35. What command would you use to create a new git repository?


- [x] git init

#### Q36. While working on a feature branch you try to use "git rerere" to solve a recurring merge conflict but nothing is happening. What could be causing this issue?


- [x] "rerere.enabled" isn't enable in the config file.


#### Q37. Which setting determines what pager is used when Git pages output?


- [x] core.pager
