<p>Securing a network from potential security risks is an important task that requires careful planning and execution. Here are some steps you can take to secure your network:</p>
<ol>
<li>

<p>Use strong passwords: Use strong, unique passwords for all devices on your network, including routers, modems, and other connected devices. Consider using a password manager to generate and store these passwords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable WPA3 encryption: Make sure that your wireless network is protected with the latest Wi-Fi security standard, WPA3. This provides strong encryption and protects your network from unauthorized access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disable WPS: Disable the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) feature on your router, as it can be vulnerable to hacking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep firmware up-to-date: Regularly check for and install firmware updates for your router and other connected devices. These updates often include security fixes for vulnerabilities that have been discovered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disable remote management: Disable remote management for your router unless it is necessary for your specific use case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a firewall: A firewall helps to block unauthorized access to your network and can be a hardware device or a software program. Consider using both a hardware firewall and a software firewall for added protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use VPN: Consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to secure your internet connection when accessing sensitive information. A VPN encrypts all data that is transmitted between your device and the VPN server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor your network: Regularly monitor your network for unusual activity, such as sudden spikes in traffic or new devices that have appeared on the network.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you can help to protect your network from potential security risks and keep your sensitive information safe. Remember to also educate yourself and others on good cybersecurity practices to further strengthen your network's security.</p>
