<p>We can use the <code>wmic</code> command in Windows to check the speed of your network connection. To do this, you can run the following command in the Command Prompt:</p>
<div>
<div>csharp<button>Copy code</button></div>
<div><code>wmic NIC where "NetEnabled='True'" get Name, Speed </code></div>
</div>
<p>This will give you a list of all enabled network adapters on your system, along with their speeds in Mbps (megabits per second). The speed reported by this command is the maximum theoretical speed of the network adapter, and may not reflect the actual speed of your network connection.</p>
