<li>
<p>Local Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities - These vulnerabilities allow attackers to escalate their privileges on a target system from a standard user to an administrator or system account, giving them greater control over the system. One example is the "Dirty COW" vulnerability (CVE-2016-5195), which affected the Linux kernel and also affected some versions of Windows, allowing attackers to gain root privileges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities - These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to crash or disable a target system or network, rendering it unavailable to users. One example is the "Ping of Death" vulnerability, which allows attackers to send malformed ICMP packets to a target system, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Browser-based vulnerabilities - Web browsers are often targeted by attackers as they can be used to download and execute malware, steal sensitive data, or hijack sessions. One example is the "Browser Helper Object" vulnerability, which allows attackers to install a plugin or add-on to a user's browser without their consent, allowing them to perform malicious actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authentication vulnerabilities - These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to a system or application. One example is the "Pass-the-Hash" vulnerability, which allows attackers to extract password hashes from a compromised system and use them to authenticate to other systems or applications.</p>
