* Install OpenVPN: Install the OpenVPN server software on the machine you have selected to act as the VPN server. This can usually be done through the package manager of your operating system.

* Configure the Server: Create a configuration file for the OpenVPN server, specifying the server's IP address and port, the location of the SSL/TLS certificates and keys, and other settings such as the encryption algorithm to be used.
* Configure the Clients: Create a client configuration file for each client, specifying the location of the client's SSL/TLS certificate and key, the IP address of the OpenVPN server, and other settings such as the encryption algorithm to be used.
* Start the Server: Start the OpenVPN server using the configuration file you created.
* Distribute the client configuration files: Distribute the client configuration files to each client, along with the necessary SSL/TLS certificates and keys.
* Test the connection: Test the connection from each client to the OpenVPN server to ensure that it is working properly.
