There are several ways to create an art generator with different traits and meta data. One approach is to use a machine learning algorithm such as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate new images based on a dataset of existing art. The dataset can be curated to include specific traits or meta data, such as the style of a particular artist or a specific color palette. Another approach is to use a rule-based system to generate art, where different rules can be used to control different traits or meta data. Additionally, you could use a combination of both machine learning and rule-based methods to create the generator.
