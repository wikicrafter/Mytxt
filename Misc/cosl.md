## To creating your own scripting language u need several steps:
1. Define the syntax and semantics of the language, including the data types and variables, control structures, functions, and any special features or libraries that you want the language to have. This step requires a good understanding of programming concepts and the ability to design a coherent and consistent language.
2. Implement a lexer and parser to translate the source code into a format that can be understood by a computer, such as an abstract syntax tree (AST). This step requires a good understanding of formal language theory and the ability to use tools like lexer and parser generators (e.g. ANTLR, LEX, and YACC)
3. Develop an interpreter or compiler to execute the code or translate it into machine code. This step requires a good understanding of low-level computer architecture and the ability to write efficient and optimized code. If you choose to use a compiler generator like LLVM or GCC, you still need to understand the architecture and write the code that connects your language to the generated compiler.
4. Test the language and debug any errors. This step requires the ability to write test cases that cover all the features of your language and the skill to debug and fix any issues.
5. Document the language for others to use and potentially contribute to the development. This step requires the ability to write clear and concise documentation and the willingness to engage with the community.

It's a challenging task that requires a lot of time, effort and expertise in many areas of computer science. It's also worth noting that creating a new language may not be the best solution to solve a problem and you may consider using an existing language instead.
