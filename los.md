<p >A Linux live kit is a collection of tools and resources used to create a live Linux environment that can be booted and run from a USB drive, CD/DVD, or other removable media. The live environment typically includes a complete operating system (usually a lightweight distribution), a set of pre-installed applications, and configuration files that allow users to customize the environment.</p>
<p >Linux live kits are often used for various purposes, such as system recovery, computer forensics, security testing, or as a portable working environment. By using a live kit, users can avoid installing a full operating system on their computer, which can be time-consuming and potentially damaging if something goes wrong.</p>
<p >Live kits can be created using specialized tools such as Ubuntu's "Startup Disk Creator" or "UNetbootin", or by manually creating a custom configuration using a set of scripts and tools. Some popular live Linux distributions include Ubuntu Live, Kali Linux Live, and Fedora Live.</p>

I would recommend Fedora <br>

<p>To manually create a custom live Fedora environment with the software you want, for instance: you can follow these general steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download the latest Fedora Live image from the official Fedora website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a persistent overlay on the USB drive by creating a partition labeled "live-rw". This allows you to save changes made during the live session, such as installing additional software or configuring settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mount the ISO image and extract the contents to the USB drive using a tool like "rsync".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install the desired software packages using the "dnf" package manager. For example, to install AnyDesk, TeamViewer, 7zip, OpenVPN, Brave, Edge, Beepeeb, and Tor, you can run the following command:</p>
<div>
<div>r<button>Copy code</button></div>
<div><code>dnf install -y anydesk teamviewer p7zip openvpn brave-browser microsoft-edge beepeeb tor </code></div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure the Tor network by editing the Tor configuration file located at "/etc/tor/torrc". You can add your desired configuration options, such as setting up a bridge or configuring a custom exit node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customize the desktop environment and other settings as desired, such as changing the wallpaper or adding shortcuts to the desktop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have finished customizing the live environment, unmount the USB drive and it will be ready to use.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that this is just a general outline and the specific steps may vary depending on your setup and requirements. You may also want to consider automating the process using a tool like "livecd-creator" or creating a custom kickstart file to automate the installation and configuration process.</p>
