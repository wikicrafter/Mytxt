<p>A WiFi range extender, also known as a WiFi repeater, works by receiving the wireless signal from your existing router and amplifying it. Here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The range extender connects to your existing router's WiFi network and establishes a connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The range extender receives the wireless signal from the router and amplifies it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amplified signal is then broadcasted by the range extender to areas of your home or office where the original signal was weak or not present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devices in these areas can now connect to the range extender's WiFi network and receive the strengthened signal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The range extender acts as a bridge, forwarding the data between the devices and the original router.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By increasing the strength and reach of the wireless signal, a WiFi range extender can help eliminate dead spots and improve the overall coverage of your WiFi network. Some range extenders also have additional features, such as parental controls, guest networks, and advanced security options.</p>
