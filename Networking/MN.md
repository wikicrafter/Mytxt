Network Monitoring Tools
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wireshark: Wireshark is a powerful network protocol analyzer that allows you to see what's happening on your network at a microscopic level. It can be used to capture, analyze, and inspect network traffic in real-time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nagios: Nagios is a popular open-source network monitoring tool that can be used to monitor hosts, services, and network devices. It provides alerts when something goes wrong and can also be used to monitor performance metrics such as network bandwidth and CPU usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Snort: Snort is an open-source intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS) that can be used to detect and prevent cyberattacks on your network. It uses a rule-based language to detect and prevent malicious traffic, and it can be used in conjunction with other security tools such as firewalls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nmap: Nmap is a network scanner that can be used to map out a network and detect devices and services running on it. It can be used to detect new devices that have appeared on the network and identify potential security risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suricata: Suricata is an open-source network threat detection tool that can be used to detect and prevent cyberattacks. It supports multiple intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) methods and can be used to monitor network traffic in real-time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When choosing a tool to monitor your network, consider your specific needs and the size and complexity of your network. Some tools, such as Wireshark, are more technical and require a deeper understanding of networking, while others, such as Nagios, are more user-friendly and easier to set up and use.</p>
<p>Remember, regularly monitoring your network is a critical step in detecting and preventing security threats. By using open-source tools, you can keep a close eye on your network and stay ahead of potential security risks.</p>
