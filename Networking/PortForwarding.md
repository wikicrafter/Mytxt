Port forwarding is a networking technique used to redirect incoming network traffic to a specific device on a private network. It is used to allow access to a device on the internal network from the internet.

Here's how it works:

When a device on the internet attempts to access a device on the private network, the request is sent to the router.

The router, which acts as a firewall, checks the incoming request against its port forwarding rules.

If the request matches a port forwarding rule, the router forwards the request to the specified device on the internal network.

The device on the internal network processes the request and sends a response back to the device on the internet.

The response is sent back through the router to the original device.

By using port forwarding, you can make certain services, such as web servers, game servers, or VPN servers, available to the internet. The specific port forwarding rule specifies which incoming request to the router should be redirected to which device on the internal network.

It is important to note that while port forwarding can be useful, it also opens up your network to potential security risks, as it allows direct access to a device on the internal network from the internet. Therefore, it's important to properly secure the devices on the internal network and keep the router's firmware up-to-date.
