ERC20 is a technical standard for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for implementing tokens. It defines a common set of rules for Ethereum tokens to follow, such as how token transfers are executed and how data within each token is accessed. This allows for interoperability between different tokens, as any wallet or exchange that supports the ERC20 standard will be able to interact with any ERC20 token. Additionally, it also provides a clear contract interface for developers to implement, making it easier for them to create new tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC20 token also uses the same function signature and function call methods as the built-in token of Ethereum, Ether, which makes it easy to use and understand.

### How to exchange your ERC20 tokens?
There are several ways to exchange ERC20 tokens for other tokens:
* Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): These are peer-to-peer platforms that allow users to trade ERC20 tokens directly with each other without the need for a central authority. Examples of DEXs include Uniswap, Kyber Network, and 0x Protocol.
* Centralized Exchanges (CEXs): These are platforms that act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, and typically require users to create an account and go through a KYC (know your customer) process. Examples of CEXs include Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.
* 

### There are several ways to give utility to an ERC20 token, including
* Using the token as a form of currency within a decentralized application (dApp)
* Using the token as a form of access or membership to a platform or service
* Using the token as a form of governance or decision-making within a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)
* Using the token as a form of collateral for lending or borrowing
* Using the token for staking or participating in consensus mechanisms
* Using the token for liquidity provision on decentralized exchanges.
It's important to note that the utility of a token is subjective and can vary depending on the specific project or use case.

### To make your own token u need: 
Creating your own token that can be exchanged for fiat currency (e.g. USD, EUR, etc.) is a complex process that typically involves the following steps:

* Develop a business plan and conduct market research to determine the potential demand for your token and its use case.
* Create the technical specifications for your token, including its total supply, issuance schedule, and any built-in smart contract functionality.
* Develop or hire a team to build the necessary infrastructure for your token, including a blockchain, a wallet, and an exchange
* Obtain any necessary legal and regulatory compliance, such as registering with financial regulators and obtaining a money transmitter license.
* Conduct a public offering or initial coin offering (ICO) to raise funds for the development of your project.
* List your token on crypto exchanges and make arrangements for fiat on- and off-ramping.

Please note that this is a simplified version of the process and each step is complex in its own right, it's highly recommended to seek legal and financial advice before attempting to create and launch your own token.
